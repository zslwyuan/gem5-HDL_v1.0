# gem5-HDL_v1.0

### Now gem5-HDL has been included in a complete and latest project named [PAAS](https://github.com/zslwyuan/PAAS_V1.0). In that project, more interesting features of state-of-art CPU-FPGA system are implemented and detailed manual is provided. The paper, PAAS: A system level simulator for heterogeneous computing architectures, about PAAS can be found at [this link in IEEEXplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8056775).


gem5-HDL make the simulation of CPU-FPGA system much easier because it realize the communication between C/C++ and Verilog in the heterogeneous system. This project is nearly finished, thanks to Prof. Wei ZHANG, Liang FENG and Sinha Sharad's help.

If you have problem in using gem5-HDL, please feel free to send a email to tliang@ust.hk.

We are glad if this simulator will help your project. Please make the citation when you apply gem5-HDL in your work which will be published.
